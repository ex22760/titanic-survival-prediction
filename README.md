# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 

This repository showcases my solution to Kaggleâ€™s iconic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition â€” where the challenge is to predict passenger survival using real-world data and classification models. Featuring robust feature engineering, advanced imputation techniques, and a tuned Random Forest pipeline, this project achieved a top 10% accuracy score on the leaderboard.

## Workflow

This notebook walks through the following key steps:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Survival rate by gender and age
- Distribution analysis of age and fares

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted **honorifics** from passenger names
- Grouped **cabins** by deck
- Calculated **family size** and identified **single mothers**
- Removed redundant/collinear features (e.g. high correlation between `SibSp` and `FamilySize`)

### 3. Imputation Techniques Explored
- Mean/Median/Mode imputation (with group-based logic)
- Random imputation (performed best)

- Stratified random sampling
- Advanced methods: **MICE**, **MissForest**, **KNN**

### 4. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- Capped outliers
- Log, Box-Cox, and Yeo-Johnson transformations
-

- Encoded rare labels in categorical columns
- Calculated permutation-based feature importances:

### 5. Modelling and Grid Search
- Built pipelines with:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Logistic Regression
- **Final model**: `RandomForestClassifier` + `GridSearchCV`
  - Best Params: `max_depth=5`, `min_samples_split=10`, `n_estimators=30`
  - Train Accuracy: **0.851**
  - Test Accuracy: **0.825**
